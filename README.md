# Attention Trainer - Chrome Extension

> Combat doom scrolling with adaptive interventions and behavioral insights

## 🎯 Overview

Attention Trainer is a Chrome extension designed to help users recognize and reduce unproductive scrolling patterns. It detects prolonged or repetitive scrolling behaviors, intervenes with progressively stronger visual cues, and provides detailed analytics to promote conscious browsing habits.

Unlike aggressive blocking tools, Attention Trainer uses subtle behavioral nudges and self-awareness techniques to help users maintain focus during online work or study.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 **Scroll Monitoring Engine**
- Real-time detection of scrolling behavior across all websites
- Intelligent pattern recognition for infinite scroll detection

2. **Stage 2**: Mild blur effect on non-interactive elements  
3. **Stage 3**: Motivational overlay with nudge messages
4. **Stage 4**: Temporary scroll lock (Strict mode only)

### 🎮 **Focus Modes**
